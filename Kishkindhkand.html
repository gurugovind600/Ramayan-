After attaining the kingdom, Sugriva indulged in luxury and the rainy and autumn seasons passed. On Rama 's displeasure, Sugriva sent the monkeys to search for Sita . The monkeys who went in search of Sita saw an ascetic in a cave. Tapaswini took the search team to the beach with Yoga Shakti, where she met Sampati . Sampati told the monkeys that Ravana had kept Sita in the Ashokvatika of Lanka . Jambavan asked Hanuman to cross the ocean butHow will Hanuman ji go so far? Then Hanuman ji asked Jambwant ji that "How will I be able to go so far." Then Jambwant ji reminded him of his powers and told that he used to harass Shri Bhriguvanshi ji, due to which he got fed up and cursed Hanuman, "You forget your strength and brilliance forever but when someone remembers you your powers. Only then will you be able to use it."</h1>
