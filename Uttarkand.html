  Uttarkand is the epilogue of Ram Katha. Rama returned to Ayodhya with Sita , Lakshmana and all the monkey army . Ram was given a grand welcome, with Bharata , the joy spread among all. Rama 's coronation took place with the praise of Vedas and Shiva . The monkeys were given farewell. Ram He preached to the subjects and the subjects expressed their gratitude. Then the subjects accused the character of Sita and Sita was sacrificed by Rama for the sake of the subjects. After renunciation, Sita went to the forest and started living in the ashram of Maharishi Valmiki. She was pregnant at that time. When the time came, the four brothers had two sons. When Luv Kush grew up, he came to Ayodhya to seek justice for his mother, but due to the wishes of the subjects, Sita was again called for examination and she passed her test and joined the earth with Mother Earth. Due to Kaal's promise, Rama abandoned Lakshmana and after the sons grew up, dividing the kingdom among them all and went to their abode, Ramrajya became an ideal.</h1>
