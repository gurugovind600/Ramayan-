<h1 style="color:white">Ayodhyakanda is a part (kand or step) of Valmiki 's Ramayana and Goswami Tulsidas 's Shri Ram Charit Manas .
  Some time after Rama 's marriage , King Dasharatha wanted to do the coronation of Rama . On this the deities got worried that the killing of Ravana would be impossible if Rama got the kingdom . Distraught, he prayed to Goddess Saraswati to take some kind of remedy. Saraswati turned the intellect of Manthara , Kaikeyi 's maidservant. Kaikeyi went to Kopbhavan on Manthara 's advice . When Dasharatha came to celebrate, Kaikeyi asked him for a boon that Bharata should be made king and Rama should be sent into exile for fourteen years.
 Sita and Lakshmana also went to the forest with Rama . In Ringverpur , Nishadraj Guha did a lot of service to all three. After some hesitation, the boatman brought the three across the river Ganges . After reaching Prayag , Rama met Bhardwaj Muni. From there Ram reached the ashram of sage Valmiki taking a bath in Yamuna . Rama , Sita and Lakshmana started residing in Chitrakoot according to the advice from Valmiki .
Dasaratha died in Ayodhya due to the separation of his son . Vashishtha called Bharata and Shatrughna from their maternal grandmother. Upon his return, Bharata rebuked his mother Kaikeyi , for her deviousness, and performed the funeral rites of Dasharatha as per the orders of the gurus . Bharata rejected the kingdom of Ayodhya and went to Chitrakoot with all his relatives to bring back Rama . Kaikeyi also felt very remorse for his actions. Sita 's parents SunaynaAnd Janak also reached Chitrakoot . Bharata and all the others proposed Rama to return to Ayodhya and rule, which Rama rejected for obeying his father and following the rituals of Raghuvansh .
  Bharata , along with his dear people, came back to Ayodhya with Rama's paduka . He placed Rama 's paduka on the royal throne and himself started residing in Nandigram.</h1>
