<h1 style="color:white">Balkand is a part (kand or step) of Valmiki 's Ramayana and Goswami Tulsidas 's Shri Ram Charit Manas .<br>
 In the city of Ayodhya there
 was a king named Dasharatha 
 who had wives named 
 Kaushalya , Kaikeyi and 
 Sumitra . Ayodhyapati
 Dasharatha performed Putrakameshti Yagya 
 on the orders of his guru 
 Shri Vashishtha to get 
 children, which was performed
 by the sage Ringi. Agnidev 
 was pleased to receive 
 the devotional offerings and 
 he himself appeared and gave 
 the Havishyapatra 
 (Kheer, Payas) to King 
 Dasharatha, which he 
 distributed among his three 
 wives. As a result of 
 consumption of kheer, Rama 
 was born from Kaushalya's 
 womb, Bharata from Kaikeyi's 
 womb and Lakshmana and 
 Shatrughna from Sumitra's 
 womb.<br>
  When the princes grew up, 
  sage Vishwamitra asked 
  King Dasharatha to take Rama 
  and Lakshmana with him 
  to protect the ashram from 
  the demons. Rama killed 
  the demons like Tadka 
  and Subahu and sent 
  Maricha across the ocean 
  by killing him with an 
  arrow without fruit. On 
  the other hand, 
  Lakshmana killed the 
  entire army of demons. 
  On receiving the invitation 
  of King Janak for the bow 
  yagya, Vishwamitra along 
  with Rama and Lakshmana came 
  to his city of 
  Mithila (Janakpur). On the 
  way, Rama saved Gautam 
  Muni's wife Ahalya. In 
  Mithila, Sita, the daughter 
  of King Janak, also known 
  as Janaki, also organized 
  a swayamvara, where, 
  according to Janaki's 
  promise, Rama married Sita 
  by breaking the 
  bow. Simultaneously with 
  the marriage of Rama and 
  Sita, Guru Vashistha 
  got Bharata to 
  Mandvi, Lakshmana to Urmila 
  and Shatrughan to Shrutkirti.</h1><br>
